This project served as an exciting platform for me to delve into the world of robotics and gain hands-on experience with inverse kinematics.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-project">The Project
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Hexy is more than just a toy; it&amp;rsquo;s a sophisticated learning tool that allowed me to explore various aspects of robotics:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Assembly&lt;/strong>: I purchased Hexy as a kit and assembled it myself, gaining valuable experience in robot construction.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Hardware&lt;/strong>: The robot features a modified Arduino Mega board, which serves as its brain and control center.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Programming&lt;/strong>: I programmed Hexy using C++, honing my skills in embedded systems programming.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Inverse Kinematics&lt;/strong>: Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of this project was learning about inverse kinematics - the mathematical process of determining joint angles to achieve a desired position of the robot&amp;rsquo;s legs.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="learning-outcomes">Learning Outcomes
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Working with Hexy has been an incredible learning experience:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Practical Robotics&lt;/strong>: Gained hands-on experience in building and programming a real robot.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Arduino&lt;/strong>: Deepened my understanding of Arduino-based systems and their applications in robotics.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>C++ for Embedded Systems&lt;/strong>: Improved my C++ programming skills in the context of embedded systems.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Inverse Kinematics&lt;/strong>: Acquired a basic understanding of inverse kinematics and its crucial role in robot movement.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="future-plans">Future Plans
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>While Hexy has already taught me a lot, there&amp;rsquo;s always room for more learning and improvement:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Implement more complex movement patterns&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Integrate sensors for autonomous behavior&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Explore machine learning applications for adaptive locomotion&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Hexy has been an invaluable project in my journey into robotics. It&amp;rsquo;s not just about building a cool hexapod; it&amp;rsquo;s about the knowledge gained in mechanics, electronics, and programming. This project has sparked a deeper interest in robotics and laid a foundation for future, more complex robotic endeavors.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>DIY Robots: Hubert and Plotter</title><link>https://ignaciodelgado.com/spare-time/robots/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ignaciodelgado.com/spare-time/robots/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://ignaciodelgado.com/spare-time/robots/robots.webp" alt="Featured image of post DIY Robots: Hubert and Plotter" />&lt;p>This page showcases two small robotics projects I&amp;rsquo;ve created: Hubert, a biped robot, and Plotter, a 2D drawing robot. Both were built using a combination of 3D printed parts and salvaged computer components.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="hubert-the-biped-robot">Hubert: The Biped Robot
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Hubert is a modified version of the Zowi biped robot, originally designed by BQ.

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Key features of Hubert:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Brown in color&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Based on the Zowi biped robot design&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Modified from the original BQ version&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Controlled by Arduino&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I ended up donating Hubert to my high school, where it can inspire other students interested in robotics.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="plotter-the-2d-drawing-robot">Plotter: The 2D Drawing Robot
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Plotter is a small project that functions like a 2D version of a 3D printer.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Key features of Plotter:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Can draw in 2D when given a pen or pencil&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Built using 3D printed parts&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Controlled by Arduino&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Plotter can be used for creating simple drawings, signatures, or even as a base for more complex 2D CNC projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="building-process">Building Process
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Both robots were created using a combination of:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>3D printed parts&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Scrap computer components&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Arduino boards for control&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This approach to building robots demonstrates how you can create interesting and functional projects with a mix of new technology (3D printing) and recycled materials.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These projects show that with some creativity and basic electronics knowledge, you can build fun and educational robots using readily available materials and open-source designs.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
