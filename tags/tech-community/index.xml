It was an &lt;strong>amazing experience&lt;/strong> that left me feeling accomplished and eager for more opportunities to speak publicly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Public speaking is an area where I&amp;rsquo;m actively working to improve:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I enjoy the challenge of speaking in public&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It&amp;rsquo;s an opportunity to share knowledge and connect with others&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Each experience helps me grow more confident&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I hope to give more talks in the near future. Potential venues include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Another DSC event&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Local Hackerspace meetups&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Other tech community gatherings&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Every opportunity to speak publicly is a step forward in personal and professional growth.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
