&lt;/h1>&lt;p>Hackapet is an software development project designed to assist animal shelters and help programmers who are looking to get experience.
I am the main leader, and it is mainly organized by us at the Hackerspace Valencia. We are a team of more than 16 members, interdisciplinary with DevOps, Development (Mobile, and Web), Management, and Desing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The project is divided into three main phases:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>{{&amp;lt; admonition note &amp;ldquo;Project Overview&amp;rdquo; &amp;gt;}}
Hackapet aims to help animal shelter operations and pet adoption processes through free/libre software solutions.

&lt;h2 id="phase-1-shelter-management">Phase 1: Shelter Management
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Creating an internal tool for managing pets in shelters. It includes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Digitizing information about the sheltered animals&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Registration and monitoring of pets&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Handling data for various types of animals&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Storing detailed information about each animal&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="phase-2-online-adoption-platform">Phase 2: Online Adoption Platform
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This phase involves developing a web platform where:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Shelters can publish profiles of pets available for adoption&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Potential adopters can search and contact shelters&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Additional options such as temporary financial sponsorship are offered&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="phase-3-post-adoption-monitoring-tool">Phase 3: Post-adoption Monitoring Tool
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The final phase of the project focuses on:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Developing a tool to follow up on adoptions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Verifying that adopted pets are well cared for in their new homes&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>{{&amp;lt; admonition warning &amp;ldquo;Note to Contributors&amp;rdquo; &amp;gt;}}
Remember that all phases of this project are crucial for its success. Your dedication and expertise in each area will make a significant difference in the lives of shelter animals.

&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Hackapet started in December 2023, as a simple idea for connecting potential pet adopters with pet shelters, now it is going to be a suite of tools for pet shelters and has over 6 members. I am truly proud of what this has come to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I just want to thank everyone for staying here strong, and we will deliver the first proof of concept soon, we first have to have more meetings with pet shelters and improve on the ideas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All in all, I believe in the great team we are building and just couldn&amp;rsquo;t be any happier to be part of this great community.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
