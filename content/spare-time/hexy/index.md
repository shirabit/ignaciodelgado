Hexy is a small hexapod robot that I purchased and assembled. This project served as an exciting platform for me to delve into the world of robotics and gain hands-on experience with inverse kinematics.


## The Project

Hexy is more than just a toy; it's a sophisticated learning tool that allowed me to explore various aspects of robotics:

1. **Assembly**: I purchased Hexy as a kit and assembled it myself, gaining valuable experience in robot construction.

2. **Hardware**: The robot features a modified Arduino Mega board, which serves as its brain and control center.

3. **Programming**: I programmed Hexy using C++, honing my skills in embedded systems programming.

4. **Inverse Kinematics**: Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of this project was learning about inverse kinematics - the mathematical process of determining joint angles to achieve a desired position of the robot's legs.

## Learning Outcomes

Working with Hexy has been an incredible learning experience:

- **Practical Robotics**: Gained hands-on experience in building and programming a real robot.
- **Arduino**: Deepened my understanding of Arduino-based systems and their applications in robotics.
- **C++ for Embedded Systems**: Improved my C++ programming skills in the context of embedded systems.
- **Inverse Kinematics**: Acquired a basic understanding of inverse kinematics and its crucial role in robot movement.

## Future Plans

While Hexy has already taught me a lot, there's always room for more learning and improvement:

- Implement more complex movement patterns
- Integrate sensors for autonomous behavior
- Explore machine learning applications for adaptive locomotion


Hexy has been an invaluable project in my journey into robotics. It's not just about building a cool hexapod; it's about the knowledge gained in mechanics, electronics, and programming. This project has sparked a deeper interest in robotics and laid a foundation for future, more complex robotic endeavors.
