![Cardable](cardable.webp)

Cardable is an innovative project aimed at redefining the way we exchange business cards. It's an Android application designed to make sharing contact information easier, faster, and more environmentally friendly.

## The problem

Back in 2019, after attending several conferences and events, I found myself with a hefty stack of business cards. This realization sparked an idea to streamline the process of exchanging contact information while reducing paper waste.

## The solution

An app for exchanging contact information as quick as scanning a QR code or with an NFC tap.

Key features include:
- QR code scanning for quick information exchange
- NFC tap functionality for seamless sharing
- Digital storage of contact information
- Reduction in paper waste from traditional business cards

## Project Status

The project is currently in active development and use.

## Project Showcase and Growth

I had the opportunity to showcase Cardable at a local Hackerspace event. The response was overwhelming:

- The Hackerspace was filled to capacity for the presentation
- We created digital business cards for all attendees
- The success of the event led to the creation of cardable.org

## Real-World Impact

Cardable has grown beyond its initial concept and is now fulfilling a real need in the business community:

- We've helped numerous businesses transition to digital business cards
- Expanded our offerings to include metal and wooden business cards with integrated NFC and QR codes
- These physical cards maintain a premium feel while offering the convenience of digital information sharing

## Technologies Used

The project utilizes:
- Android
- Kotlin
- Graphic Design
- UX/UI Design
- NFC Technology
- QR Code Generation

Cardable has evolved from a concept to a practical solution, modernizing traditional business cards and making networking more efficient and environmentally friendly. Its success demonstrates the real-world demand for innovative contact-sharing solutions.
