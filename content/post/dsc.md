I had the honor of giving a small talk at a local Developer Student Club (DSC) in collaboration with other universities, including Cartagena's Polytechnic University. It was an **amazing experience** that left me feeling accomplished and eager for more opportunities to speak publicly.

Public speaking is an area where I'm actively working to improve:

- I enjoy the challenge of speaking in public
- It's an opportunity to share knowledge and connect with others
- Each experience helps me grow more confident

I hope to give more talks in the near future. Potential venues include:

- Another DSC event
- Local Hackerspace meetups
- Other tech community gatherings

Every opportunity to speak publicly is a step forward in personal and professional growth.
