Both were built using a combination of 3D printed parts and salvaged computer components.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="hubert-the-biped-robot">Hubert: The Biped Robot
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Hubert is a modified version of the Zowi biped robot, originally designed by BQ.

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Key features of Hubert:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Brown in color&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Based on the Zowi biped robot design&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Modified from the original BQ version&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Controlled by Arduino&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I ended up donating Hubert to my high school, where it can inspire other students interested in robotics.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="plotter-the-2d-drawing-robot">Plotter: The 2D Drawing Robot
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Plotter is a small project that functions like a 2D version of a 3D printer.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Key features of Plotter:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Can draw in 2D when given a pen or pencil&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Built using 3D printed parts&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Controlled by Arduino&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Plotter can be used for creating simple drawings, signatures, or even as a base for more complex 2D CNC projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="building-process">Building Process
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Both robots were created using a combination of:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>3D printed parts&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Scrap computer components&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Arduino boards for control&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This approach to building robots demonstrates how you can create interesting and functional projects with a mix of new technology (3D printing) and recycled materials.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These projects show that with some creativity and basic electronics knowledge, you can build fun and educational robots using readily available materials and open-source designs.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
